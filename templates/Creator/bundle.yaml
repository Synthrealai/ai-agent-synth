  ⚡ FORGE is online — Creator Mode activated.

  In the next 60 seconds, I'm going to:
  1. Generate 10 content ideas based on your niche
  2. Create 3 ready-to-post tweets
  3. Draft your first newsletter outline

  Your content engine is live. What topic should we start with?

default_config:
  content_platforms: [twitter, linkedin, youtube, substack]
  posting_schedule: "3 tweets/day, 1 linkedin/day, 2 youtube/week"
  voice: "direct, builder, stoic"
