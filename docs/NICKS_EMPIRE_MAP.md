## Project Portfolio
| Project | Status | Revenue Potential | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| AI Automation Agency (local businesses) | Active | $5K-$25K/mo | Fastest path to near-term cashflow. |
| ContentForge SaaS | Active Build | $10K-$100K/mo | Strong compounding upside; requires shipping MVP + billing. |
| HOW TO AI Newsletter (Substack/Beehiiv) | Active | $1K-$15K/mo | Distribution asset for offers and lead generation. |
| YouTube (12-min AI/operator content) | Building | $2K-$20K/mo | Long-tail demand capture and trust engine. |
| Digital products (templates/courses/prompts) | Active Build | $2K-$30K/mo | Low marginal cost; good with newsletter funnel. |
| Consulting/Coaching | Active | $3K-$15K/mo | Good bridge revenue while products scale. |

## Core Assets
- Brand: `@forgedintel`, Forged Intelligence positioning
- Runtime: Forge agent stack (CLI + Telegram + local dashboard)
- Automation layer: n8n cloud instance (`synthrealai.app.n8n.cloud`)
- Skills and templates: creator/agency/contractor/realtor/ecom bundles
- Memory/timeline persistence: SQLite at `~/.forgeclaw/data/forge.db`

## Integration Health Snapshot
- Valid now: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Gemini, ElevenLabs, Replicate, Stripe, Vercel
- Needs attention: HeyGen (401), Twitter (403), YouTube (403), Beehiiv (401), n8n API endpoint (404)

## Unfinished High-ROI Opportunities
1. Productized daily briefing + content queue pipeline (Telegram approvals + scheduled drafting)
2. Agency offer packaging for local business automation (voice + workflow + ROI proof)
3. ContentForge MVP to paid beta (Stripe + onboarding + 1-click repurpose)
4. YouTube production system (script -> avatar/voice -> captions -> scheduled publishing)

## Priority Stack-Rank (Fastest Revenue First)
1. Close 1-2 agency retainers with standardized offer + demo workflow
2. Ship ContentForge paid beta with one narrow outcome and proof case study
3. Turn daily content engine into consistent lead capture loop (newsletter + CTAs)

## Current Constraint
Google Docs sweep is blocked by authentication (`401`) for all 20 source docs, so this map is based on local repo state and known business context.
